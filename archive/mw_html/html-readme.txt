SUPPORT

While this HTML version of Monier-Williams is freely available, the
financial cost of developing a resource such as the Cologne Digital
Sanskrit Dictionaries remains significant. Those who find this version
useful might consider supporting the continued development of the
Cologne Sanskrit Dictionary Project. Contributions should be sent to:

    Cologne Sanskrit Dictionary Project
    Institute of Indology and Tamil Studies (IITS)
    University of Cologne

CD-ROM VERSION

Please note that a CD-ROM version of the Monier-Williams
Sanskrit-English Dictionary is also available. It includes a fully
indexed database application for searching under Microsoft Windows (98
SE through to at least XP). On a reasonably fast computer, the CD-ROM
version gives virtually instantaneous display of your search. It also
includes the Cappeller Dictionary and reverse lookup that allows you
to search English words within a definition and then to display that
Sanskrit word along with its definition. You can almost
instantaneously switch between Cappeller and Monier-Williams
definitions. Text is editable, but great care must be taken to
preserve database links.
